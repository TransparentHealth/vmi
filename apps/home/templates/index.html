                    select organizations. Created to solve health data sharing issues in the United States,

                    <p> Creating a <strong>member account</strong> automatically shares with one organization.
                    A person (agent) from this organization is responsible for verifying your identity and activating your account.
                    You can then login to this service and other services which rely on {{ settings.APPLICATION_TITLE }}.
                    {{ settings.APPLICATION_TITLE }} provides these applications with a stronger level (2) of
                    your identity.  When you login to these applications, the list of organizations with whom you are a member
                    are shared. Read more about how <a href="">{{ settings.APPLICATION_TITLE|title }} works for the people</a>.

                    An <strong> agent account </strong> is also a member account, but this user has
                    additional permissions such as the ability to verify other member's identity and
                    to access to member data on behalf of a given organization.  When an agent logs into
                    an application using {{ settings.APPLICATION_TITLE|title }}, a list of organizations
                    for whom the person is an agent is shared with the application.
